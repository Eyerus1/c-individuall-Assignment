NAME EYERUSALEM HABTEGEBREAL ID DBU1501186 Emergency Response Simulation is a simple C# console application that simulates how different emergency units (Police, Firefighters, and Ambulances) respond to various incidents (Crime, Fire, or Medical emergencies) at random locations (like the Market, Park, etc.).

During the simulation:

Each turn, a random incident is generated.

The player is shown available emergency units that can handle the incident.

The player selects a unit to respond.

Correct choices earn points (+10), and wrong choices or no available units lose points (-5).

After 5 turns, a final score is displayed.

The program uses object-oriented programming concepts like:

Abstract classes (EmergencyUnit)

Inheritance (Police, Firefighter, Ambulance)

Polymorphism (each unit responds differently to incidents)
